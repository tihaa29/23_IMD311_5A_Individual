            <br>
            <p>It is widely considered that singing is one of   the most popular hobbies in the world, along with other hobbies such as dancing. Singing is my hobby. In fact I am very passionate about it. One of the best hobbies for a person to have that keeps them happy all the time. It always keeps me happy and refreshed. Through it I am able to express my feelings about anything that is on my mind in a way that is meaningful to me. My interest in singing began at an early age, even as a child, when I was just a little girl. </p>

        <br>
        <p>Makeup as a hobby is constant fun. A person can boost their confidence through the use of makeup, which can boost their self-esteem. Yes, I have flaws, but makeup helps me embrace them. It doesn't hide it, it just makes it look much more flawless and acceptable .The art of make-up can make people, especially ladies feel more comfortable about themselves. This confidence is reflected immediately upon one's self, actions and behavior.As the days go by, I become more and more addicted to makeup.</p>

        <h7>Badminton</h7>
        <br>
        <p>Playing this sport makes me feel strong and confident. Each stroke of the racket makes the typical “whoosh” sound that I love. I feel I could rule the world with my precise and calculated strokes.I play to release some of the stress. In all moods, I like to play badminton.Everytime I played has been the time of learning new techniques and trivias on how to improve my game. Every game there were always be new players I can play with. Different approaches and different game type, it is really a challenge.</p>
